# Termux XFCE Desktop Setup

This repository provides a script to set up an XFCE desktop environment and a Debian proot installation within Termux. The setup utilizes the Termux-X11 server, which will be installed during the process. You will be prompted to allow Termux to install the corresponding Android APK.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Setup**: Simply choose your username and follow the on-screen prompts.
- **Storage Requirements**: Approximately 4GB of storage space is required. Note that additional applications will consume more space.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Please review the full README for comprehensive information about this setup.

## Installation

To install, execute the following command in Termux:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stanica/Termux_XFCE/main/install_xfce_native.sh -o install.sh && bash install.sh
```

## Starting the Desktop

To start the desktop, use the following command:

```bash
start
```

This command initiates a Termux-X11 session, starts the XFCE4 desktop, and opens the Termux-X11 app directly into the desktop.

To access the Debian proot environment from the terminal, use:

```bash
debian
```

Note: The display is pre-configured in the Debian proot environment, allowing you to launch GUI applications directly from the terminal.

## Hardware Acceleration & Proot

Several aliases are provided to simplify launching applications:

### Termux XFCE:

- `prun`: Execute commands from the Debian proot environment directly in the Termux terminal without entering the proot shell.
- `zrun`: Launch applications in Debian proot with hardware acceleration.
- `zrunhud`: Launch applications with hardware acceleration and FPS HUD.

### Debian Proot:

`debian` To enter the Debian proot environment, from there, you can install additional software using `sudo apt`.

## Additional Utilities

- `cp2menu`: Copy `.desktop` files from Debian proot to the Termux XFCE menu for easy access.
- `app-installer`: Easy to use GUI app to manage installing additional apps not available in Termux or Debian repositories.
